### About Me
- My name is Andrew Vu. I’m a Software Engineering Intern at Adtran and a Computer Science & Economics student at the University of Florida. I'm passionate about AI engineering, backend systems, and building tools that actually ship.
- I primarily work in Python, C++, and I’m deepening my knowledge in AI, distributed systems, and trading models.
- In my free time I like rock climbing, swimming, and game development. [Play my favorite game!](https://www.roblox.com/games/9264596435/Idle-Heroes-Simulator)
