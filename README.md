### About Me
- My name is Andrew Vu. I’m a Computer Science & Statistics student at the University of Florida and previous SWE Intern @ Adtran. I'm passionate about AI engineering, backend systems, and building tools that actually ship.
- I primarily work in Python, C++, and I’m deepening my knowledge in AI, distributed systems, and trading models.
- In my free time I like rock climbing, swimming, and game development. [Play my favorite game!](https://www.roblox.com/games/102004471989393/Make-a-Military-Army)
