### About Me
- My name is Andy. I’m an incoming Solutions Architect Intern @ NVIDIA and previous SWE Intern @ Adtran. I'm passionate about building things that people actually use.
- I primarily use Lua (roblox games), Python, and C++.
- In my free time I like rock climbing, swimming, and game development. [Play my favorite game!](https://www.roblox.com/games/102004471989393/Make-a-Military-Army)
